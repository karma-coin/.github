# Karmachain 2.0 Dart API Client

Skill level: intermediate / advance
Langauges: Dart, Javascript
Frameworks: polkadart, karmachain-js, polkadot api

## Overview
We'd like to have a fullly-typed api client lib in Dart for the Karmachain 2.0 RPC API, and integrate it into the Karma Coin app client. This lib will be the only way that the Karma Coin App interacts with Karmachain 2.0.

## Task Overview
1. Clone https://github.com/rankanizer/polkadart
2. Finish the missing infra RPC-related features and contribute it back to that project for integration!
3. Start a new dart pakckage project and name it **karmachain-dart-client**
4. Integrate Polkadart and [karmachain-js](https://github.com/karma-coin/karmachain-js ) to get a fully typed access to Karmachain 2.0 API
5. Implement the integration tests of karmacahin-js in dart and make sure they all pass
