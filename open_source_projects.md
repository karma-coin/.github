# Karmachain 2.0 Dart API Client

## Overview
We'd like to have a fullly-typed api client in Dart for the Karmachain 2.0 RPC API, and integrate it into the Karma Coin app client.

## Task Overview
1. Clone https://github.com/rankanizer/polkadart
2. Finish the missing infra RPC-related features and contribute it back to that project for integration!
3. Start a new dart pakckage project and name it **karmachain-dart-client**
4. Integrate Polkadart and [karmachain-js](https://github.com/karma-coin/karmachain-js ) to get a fully typed access to Karmachain 2.0 API
5. Implement the integration tests of karmacahin-js in dart and make sure they all pass
